# A/B Testing

The main goal of this project was to enhance **Hypothesis Testing** and **Data Visualization** techniques on an **A/B Testing** example ensuring the use of several key performance indicators, **KPIs**.  
**Tableau** was one of the Data Visualization techniques used on this project.

## Overview
This was a project under the Ironhack's bootcamp scope. It was a team project on the 5th and 6th week of the bootcamp.
  
The KPIs were up to the team to decide.

## Dataset
The 3 datasets used are divided as follows:
- Client profile
- Digital Footprints
- Experiment roster

## Objective
The goal was to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates. Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

## Assumptions
Since there was no knowledge on the inner workings of the platform, some assumptions were made.
This allowed customization on how the KPI metrics considered on our A/B Test were evaluated. This was an important step, because it was the key factor that tailored our test to this specific case, therefore making it more accurate when comparing the 'Control' and 'Test' groups.

## KPI's
The performance metrics evaluated on this test were the following (having in consideration the initial assumptions):
- Completion rate: Rate of successful operations (considering the right step sequence);
- Time spent on successful operation;
- Error: Re-starting the operation by returning to the initial page;
- Error: Incorrect timestamp readings associated to a malfunction.
